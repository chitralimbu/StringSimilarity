# StringSimilarity
Testing out methods for comparing similarity/ precision between 2 strings

Currently playing around with Levenshtein Distance.
A problem arose where I needed to match a String to a list of other strings, where some characters or words in the strings
may have been substituted.
After not getting the results I want with the Levenshtein distance, I am going to attempt the: Sørensen–Dice_coefficient 
to see if I can get the results I want.
